# Elementary-Statistics-Westminster-College-R
R materials for the Elementary Statistics course at Westminster College, Salt Lake City, UT.

For each R Markdown assignment, there is the .rmd file and a corresponding .pdf file.

The document Learning_R_Markdown uses some tricks to get knitr to generate a PDF that has "verbatim" environments to show students what to type in their own R Markdown documents. As a result, the R Markdown file does not generate good HTML. In particular, the preview on GitHub is not correct. Please look at the PDF file to see what students should be looking at.
