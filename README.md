# Intro_Stats_WC

R materials for DATA 220 (Introduction to Statistics) at Westminster College, Salt Lake City, UT.

For each R Markdown assignment, there is an `.Rmd` file and a corresponding `.pdf` file. The first assignment `Intro_to_R.pdf` should be distributed to students as a PDF file. At the end of that assignment, students are given instructions for downloading their first R Markdown assignment, `Using_R_Markdown.Rmd`. That R Markdown assignment and all subsequent assignments should be given to the students as R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files.
