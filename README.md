# Intro_Stats

R materials for learning statistics.

The first module `1. Introduction to R` should be distributed to students as an HTML file (the `.nb.html` file not the `.Rmd` file). Every subsequent module after the first should be given to students as an R Notebook file (`.Rmd`).

The file `Concordance.Rmd` (or the HTML version `Concordance.html`) links each of these modules to the corresponding section of the OpenIntro textbook [Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs).
