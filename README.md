# Intro_Stats

R materials for learning statistics.

The first assignment `Intro_to_R` should be distributed to students as an HTML file. At the end of that assignment, students are instructed to download their first R Markdown assignment, `Using_R_Markdown.Rmd`. That R Markdown assignment and all subsequent assignments should be completed as R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files.

The file `Concordance_between_OpenIntro_textbook_and_R_modules.pdf` links each of these assignments to the corresponding section of the OpenIntro textbook *Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation*.
