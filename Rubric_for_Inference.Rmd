This is the R Markdown outline for running inference, both a hypothesis test and a confidence interval.


## Exploratory data analysis

### Use data documentaton (help files, code books, Google, etc.), the str command, and other summary functions to understand the data.

```{r}
## Add code here to understand the data.
```

### Prepare the data for analysis. [Not always necessary.]

```{r}
## Add code here to prepare the data for analysis.
```

### Make tables or plots to explore the data visually.

```{r}
## Add code here to make tables or plots.
```


## Hypotheses

### Identify the sample (or samples) and a reasonable population (or populations) of interest.

\end{answer}

### Express the null and alternative hypotheses as contextually meaningful full sentences.

\begin{answer}
$H_0$: Null hypothesis goes here.

$H_A$: Alternative hypothesis goes here.
\end{answer}

### Express the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols.

\begin{answer}
$H_0: math$

$H_A: math$
\end{answer}


## Model

### Identify the sampling distribution model.

## Mechanics

### Compute the test statistic.

```{r}
## Add code here to compute the test statistic.
```

### Plot the null distribution.

```{r}
## Add code here to plot the null distribution.
```

### Calculate the P-value.

```{r}
## Add code here to calculate the P-value.
```


## Conclusion

### State the statistical conclusion.

\begin{answer}

\end{answer}

### State (but do not overstate) a contextually meaningful conclusion.

\begin{answer}
Please write up your answer here.
\end{answer}

### Identify the possibility of either a Type I or Type II error and state what making such an error means in the context of the hypotheses.

## Confidence interval

### Conditions
